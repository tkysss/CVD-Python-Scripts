# CVD-Python-Scripts
The python scripts to generate the searching trees of CVD problem is provided in this repository.

Please see the papaer at ___.

Python Scripts/code1.py This python script to generate the searching trees when $vc(H^v) \ge 4$. The ouput contains the structure of search trees, the branching vector and the corresponding branching factor,

Python Scripts/code2.py This python script to generate the searching trees when $vc(H^v) 3 4$ and $Twins(v)=1$. The ouput contains the structure of search trees, the branching vector and the corresponding branching factor,

Python Scripts/branching.py This python sctript is to calculate the branching factor of a branching vector.
